Due to the size of the dataset that is being used for this project, you will need to download it 
directly from the Kaggle website.

The direct link is 

https://www.kaggle.com/mishra5001/credit-card#application_data.csv

Please open the .py file and ensure that the libraries being used are available on your machine.
The libraries being used are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn and xgboost.

Within the .py file, edit lines 13 and 14 to redirect to where you have downloaded the datasets
from the link above.

The remainder of the code should run correctly and smoothly.
